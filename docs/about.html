<h4>
    On behalf of the Atlantic Ukrainian Association, a non-profit organization, created to help Ukrainian people who were impacted by this terrible war with Russia, I would like to thank all fellow Canadians for their compassion and involvement.
</h4>

<h4>
    Two weeks of continuous inhumane terror resulted in thousands of lives lost and millions of people displaced. With supplies running low and the amount of people in distress increasing by the minute everything counts.
</h4>

<h4>
    We are reaching out in hope you might help us with the medical supplies and another item of the most critical importance. Weâ€™ve recently learned that many newborns and young infants in Ukraine are on the edge of starvation due to the supply shortage, shelling of the cities and loosing their mothers, thousands of people lost everything, many animals were abandoned. The situation in Ukraine will have (and already has) devastating humanitarian consequences for tens of thousands of families. The situation is quickly becoming Europe's largest refugee crisis this century.
</h4>

<h4>
    We already sent full of medical supplies, food, hygiene products, sleeping bags and clothes. But millions of Ukrainians still need our help.
</h4>

<h4>
    Please join us! Stand with Ukraine! Slava Ukraine!
