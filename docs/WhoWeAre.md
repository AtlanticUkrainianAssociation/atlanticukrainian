#### With the beginning of war in Ukraine on February 24th, 2022, a lot of people felt the need to help those who found themselves in difficult/dangerous life circumstances. After few weeks of work, many volunteers from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, PEI, and Quebec provinces faced various challenges and decided to join their forces by creating Atlantic Ukrainian Association (AUA).

#### Today AUA unites over 1000 volunteers, who make a difference in Ukrainian people's lives every single day.

#### Our organization was recognized and supported by the provincial governments of Canada. For the last 6 months, we have shipped over 540 pallets of food, medical supplies, and hygiene which represent over 200 tons of merchandise. Our efficient logistic chain allows us to ship and track the distribution of goods in Ukraine.

#### Atlantic Ukrainian Association is committed to keep making an important impact on the Ukrainian population to improve their living conditions during the Wartime.
